# Project Title: Bad Quote Generator

## Description

Bad Quote Generator is a fun, web-based application designed to add a little humor to your day.

Built with raw JavaScript, this light-hearted app will surely bring a smile to your face, especially if you're a film buff!

Whether you need a chuckle during your break or a unique way to engage with your favorite movies, our Bad Quote Generator is here to entertain!
